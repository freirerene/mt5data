# Mt5Data

A simple -- and not optimized -- way of getting financial data **for free (!)** using MetaTrader5 **on linux (!).**

This script is especially useful in the Brazilian market -- or, really, any other market that is somewhat difficult to get access to data. One just signs up in a broker that offers MT5 and one`s golden!

One should be able to easily adapt it to run on windows.

As a bonus I also wrote a little function to get the mini-futures codes

## Notes

This does not work via ssh. You have to have access to the desktop (so metatrader can run).

Also, new server (in MTserver) to streamline the proccess.
